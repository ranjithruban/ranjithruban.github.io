For intergrating salt with rundeck or any other application it needs salt-api. To install it configure the repo of salt.

 yum install salt-api

before starting the api service generate a cert request for salt. 

 openssl genrsa -out /etc/ssl/private/key.pem 4096 

 openssl req -new -x509 -key /etc/ssl/private/key.pem -out /etc/ssl/private/cert.pem -days 18260

After this add the config for the api to salt master config.

```
rest_cherrypy:
  port: 8000
  host: <IP>
  ssl_crt: /etc/ssl/private/cert.pem
  ssl_key: /etc/ssl/private/key.pem
```

Now start the salt-master and start salt-api service. You will see port 8000 is listening. 

 systemctl start salt-master.service
 systemctl start salt-api.service

For adding a user you need to configure external_auth. For testing with rundeck you can add a user like below with only access to test.ping. 

  ```
external_auth:
  pam:
    rundeck:
      - test.ping
  ```

and then test using 

 salt -a pam '*' test.ping

Rest of the configuration on rundeck side is explained in below article.
